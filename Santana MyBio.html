    <h2>My Bio</h2>
    <img src="CesarSantana.jpg/" atl="Cesar Santana width=480 "/>
    <p>My name is Cesar Santana.I was born and raised in Puerto Rico and im a guy who loves to play video games.
        As a kid i've always loved to play a sport or play video games on the Nintendo 3DS with my little brother.
        Through the Nintendo is where i fell in love with the Video Game World.I am the older brother and
        my little brothers name is Yamil.I'm half Puerto Rican and half Dominican.My mom was born in Dominican Republic,but she moved to
        Puerto Rico at a very young age with her siblings.My dad is Puerto Rican with dominican parents,my grandpa from my fathers side lives in 
        La Romana,Dominican Republic while my dad and grandma still live in Puerto Rico along with some Aunts and cousins.

        When i was moving up to the 6th grade my mom wanted to move out of Puerto Rico in search for a bettter future for me and my brother.
        I lived with some cousins and my mom's friends for a year until my mom decided to move again but this time we moved with out granparents,who which at the time
        used to live in Rhode Island.We moved in with our grandparents and lived together for 2 years until my grandparents decided to move back to Dominican Republic,where they 
        are still living there.This was around the same time my passion for video games grew more and more.I was starting to like new things like watching anime or play video games
        non-stop because it was enjoyable.The game that made me fall in love with them the most was Fortnite, a free-to-play Battle Royale in which you can play with your buddies.
        I loved the game so much that i used to get in trouble late at night for being on the game and not getting any sleep.The feeling you get while playing with friends felt so 
        good and just having a great time with them always kept a smile on my face.
